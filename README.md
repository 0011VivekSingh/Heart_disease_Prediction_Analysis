# Heart_disease_Prediction_Analysis
As the population grows, early diagnosis and treatment of heart diseases becomes increasingly challenging. However, a number of studies have found that machine-learning approaches have advanced the health sector due to recent technological advancements. Building a machine learning model for heart disease prediction based on relevant parameters is the aim of this work. For this research project, we have employed a benchmark dataset of Cleveland heart disease, which consists of 14 distinct heart disease-related factors. The creation of the model made use of machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, and Decision Tree. In our research, we also looked for relationships between the various features included in the dataset using conventional machine learning algorithms. We then effectively applied these relationships to the prediction of the possibility of developing heart disease. The outcome demonstrates that **Random Forest** produces predictions with more accuracy in less time than other machine learning algorithms. The medical professionals may find this model beneficial as a decision support system.
